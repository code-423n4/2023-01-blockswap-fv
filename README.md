# ✨ So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

This repo and README is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)

When we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain all the information needed for contest participants. 

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (🐺)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (⭐️)**.

# Repo setup

## ⭐️ Sponsor: Add details to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/linked in this repo **no less than 24 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a 🚨code freeze🚨 for the duration of the contest — important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the contest. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ⭐️ Sponsor: Edit this README

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
  - [ ] When linking, please provide all links as full absolute links versus relative links
  - [ ] All information should be provided in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Under the "Scope" heading, provide the name of each contract and:
  - [ ] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] See also: [this checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

## C4udit / Publicly Known Issues

The C4audit output for the contest can be found [here](add link to report) within an hour of contest opening.

*Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in the C4udit output is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards.*

[ ⭐️ SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE ]

# Overview

*Please provide some context about the code being audited, and identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code. (This is a good place to link to your docs, if you have them.)*

# Scope

*List all files in scope in the table below (along with hyperlinks) -- and feel free to add notes here to emphasize areas of focus.*

*For line of code counts, we recommend using [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc).* 

| Contract | SLOC | Purpose | Libraries used |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [contracts/folder/sample.sol](contracts/folder/sample.sol) | 123 | This contract does XYZ | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |

## Out of scope

*List any files/contracts that are out of scope for this audit.*

# Additional Context

*Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts*

*Sponsor, please confirm/edit the information below.*

## Scoping Details 
```
- If you have a public code repo, please share it here:  
- How many contracts are in scope?:   
- Total SLoC for these contracts?:  
- How many external imports are there?:  
- How many separate interfaces and struct definitions are there for the contracts within scope?:  
- Does most of your code generally use composition or inheritance?:   
- How many external calls?:   
- What is the overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests?:  
- Is there a need to understand a separate part of the codebase / get context in order to audit this part of the protocol?:   
- Please describe required context:   
- Does it use an oracle?:  
- Does the token conform to the ERC20 standard?:  
- Are there any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models?: 
- Does it use a timelock function?:  
- Is it an NFT?: 
- Does it have an AMM?:   
- Is it a fork of a popular project?:   
- Does it use rollups?:   
- Is it multi-chain?:  
- Does it use a side-chain?: 
```

# Tests

*Provide every step required to build the project from a fresh git clone, as well as steps to run the tests with a gas report.* 

*Note: Many wardens run Slither as a first pass for testing.  Please document any known errors with no workaround.*
